This project is found here:

It is a very basic custom linked list class. It does not inherit from the ICollections class, so lacks many important members found in the .NET ArrayList class.

This excercise helped me to understand how linked lists are constructed at a fundamental level. It would need quite a few more additions to be very useful. For example, a Get Enumerator function would make it easier to traverse the list (as in a foreach loop).
